# Learning to Ride the Whale: Intro to Docker and Containers

This is the material prepared for Open Source Summit 2018 Vancouver C-ALE program covering Docker and
container technology.

The HTML file is a [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark)-formatted slideshow generated from markdown.
The original markdown for this particular content is from the [container.training](http://container.training)
project originally started by [jpetazzo](https://github.com/jpetazzo). A collaborative community has
continued development and refinement of this content for use in workshops worldwide over the past three
years. The source is located in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training) where collaboration on the materials continues to generate additions and improvements. Note that this intro to containers is a subset of the larger **container.training** content, which includes orchestration (both Swarm and Kubernetes) as well as other advanced topics not covered in this session.

The PDF is created from the HTML file with [decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape) which
supports taking remark-generated slideshows (among other frameworks) and converting them to PDF. Note
that the HTML file is much smaller and can be self-hosted or simply opened in a web browser easily.

The content is significantly larger than what will be covered in the 90-minute session at Open Source
Summit but is a great resource for going deeper in a self-paced fashion after the on-site tutorial.
